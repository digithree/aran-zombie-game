# Background

## Summary of Intention

The game is a slow, community and character based horror game.  The primary mechanic is the traditional RPG puzzle.

Cosy catastrophe-- plenty of genuine breaks between long episodes of gruelling horror.

## Game World

The game is set on the Arans islands, a group of three islands off the west coast of Galway bay in Ireland. The inspiration is based on the authors' visits to these islands, some fiction and non-fiction texts. The primary text is "The Aran Islands" by John M. Singe, a work of fiction produced by a well off visitor to these poor islands in the years around the turn of the 20th century. Other supplementary texts are used.

The zombie aspect is a sci-fi thought experiment; how would a zombie apocalypse unfold in a world which has a small, superstitious population, with slow communication with the mainland of Ireland? How would these people make sense of the horror and how would it affect the communities?
